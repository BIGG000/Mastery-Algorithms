Then, it discusses the importance of characterizing the particular problem that we are trying to solve. Next, it uses the famous Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as a use case and applies the different design techniques that we will be resenting. Then, it introduces linear programming and discusses its applications. Finally, it presents how linear programming can be used to solve a real-world problem.\n",

    "#### Concern 1 – Will the designed algorithm produce the result we expect?\n",
    "An algorithm is a mathematical solution to a real-world problem. To be useful, it should produce accurate results. How to verify the correctness of an algorithm should not be an afterthought; instead, it should be baked into the design of the algorithm. Before strategizing how to verify an algorithm, we need to think about the following two aspects:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defining the truth:** To verify the algorithm, we need some known correct results for a given set of inputs. These known correct results are called the truths, in the context of the problem we are trying to solve. The truth is important as it is used as a reference when we iteratively work on evolving our algorithm toward a better solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing metrics:** We also need to think about how are we going to quantify the deviation from the defined truth. Choosing the correct metrics will help us to accurately quantify the quality of our algorithm."

   "metadata": {},

    "#### Concern 2 – Is this the optimal way to get these results?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polynomial algorithm:** If an algorithm has a time complexity of O(n k ), we call it a polynomial algorithm, where k is a constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Certificate:** A proposed candidate solution produced at the end of an iteration is called a certificate. As we progress iteratively in solving a particular problem, we typically generate a series of certificates. If the solution is moving toward convergence, each generated certificate will be better than the previous one. At some point, when our certificate meets the requirements, we will choose that certificate as the final solution."
