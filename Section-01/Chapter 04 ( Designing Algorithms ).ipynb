    "In this section we discussing the different choices available to you when designing algorithms. Then, it discusses the importance of characterizing the particular problem that we are trying to solve. Next, it uses the famous Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) as a use case and applies the different design techniques that we will be resenting. Then, it introduces linear programming and discusses its applications. Finally, it presents how linear programming can be used to solve a real-world problem.\n",
